# Loose Threads and New Quests

Even with its careful engineering, OpenEvolve leaves the reader with tantalizing challenges. Consider the island sampler in `openevolve/database.py`, which balances exploration and exploitation every time it chooses a parent:

```python
rand_val = random.random()
if rand_val < self.config.exploration_ratio:
    parent = self._sample_from_island_random(island_id)
elif rand_val < self.config.exploration_ratio + self.config.exploitation_ratio:
    parent = self._sample_from_archive_for_island(island_id)
else:
    parent = self._sample_from_island_weighted(island_id)
```

Should these ratios adapt over time based on population diversity or evaluator feedback? Could reinforcement learning nudge the sampler toward more promising regions without collapsing diversity?

The evaluator’s artifact support and optional cascade stages whisper about richer feedback loops. What if the evaluator supplied gradient hints, or interacted with domain-specific profilers that teach the LLM where to look next? The `EvolutionTracer` already captures state-action-reward tuples—ripe data for training a policy that might one day steer prompts or diff selection automatically.

Finally, the system leans on template-driven prompting. How might we let the evolved code annotate itself, generating bespoke micro-prompts that evolve alongside the programs? And if multiple LLM providers become part of the ensemble, what arbitration strategies keep them from converging on the same safe edits?

OpenEvolve is functional, ambitious, and introspective. The framework invites readers to experiment with adaptive sampling, richer evaluators, and learning-from-trace techniques that could turn today’s evolutionary runs into tomorrow’s self-improving coding agents. The story is unfinished by design—go write the next chapter.
